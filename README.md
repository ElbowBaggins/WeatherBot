# WeatherBot
### [DEPRECATED] due to WeatherBot being rewritten in Kotlin using PircBotX and Forecast.IO due to Yahoo! closing their weather API. This should still work and be relatively extendable if you're brave. I'd honestly reccommend looking elsewhere though. There exist several bugs in the external SmartIRC4Net project related with SSL connections that crop up at seemingly random times. It's also not especially stable in mono.
This is the WeatherBot project that actually does something.
It has a dependency on the ChatBot.dll which gets generated by the ChatBot project.

It provides implementations of IChatBotConfig (WeatherBotConfig) and IChatBotResponder (YWeatherListener, yes I know. It's not a great name.).

Comments here are better. A bit of the code is lazy and could be better. It was just for me.

The ultimate plan for all of this is to clean it up and add dynamic loading behavior to the ChatBot core so that you don't have to link all this stuff at compile-time.
