# WeatherBot
This is the WeatherBot project that actually does something.
It has a dependency on the ChatBot.dll which gets generated by the ChatBot project.

It provides implementations of IChatBotConfig (WeatherBotConfig) and IChatBotResponder (YWeatherListener, yes I know. It's not a great name.).

Comments here are better. A bit of the code is lazy and could be better. It was just for me.

The ultimate plan for all of this is to clean it up and add dynamic loading behavior to the ChatBot core so that you don't have to link all this stuff at compile-time.
